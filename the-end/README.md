Just one final task left: _encrypted message_. 
> For **your** eyes only!

If you are too tired of writing code, but too curious to see what's inside, you can use online decryption tool like [Cyber Chef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/). Play with few combinations, and if you need a hand:

1) from Base64
2) XOR - keyword: `your username` - UTF8


## achievement : unlocked
