# google-challenge
I got a chance to participate in **secret Google foo.bar challenge**. This was really exciting journey, even though sometimes it was **_really_** hard to come up with the solution. 
To be completely honest, I haven't done everything by myself, I have used help from other participants of the challenge, and now I would be happy to be the same help for the others.

*For each of the task, I have provided an explanation on what algorithm or formula I have used - so to speak **"no spoilers"** solution. Also, I have provided **Java code** (except the first task, because unfortunately I have deleted the code I used).*

<sub>**later-patches branch** is for some changes to the code that were done AFTER I have submitted the solution. The code I used for submission is in **main branch**.</sub>

## Challenges
I have noticed that participants got different tasks on some stages. Here is my list:

**First stage**
- [Skipping Work](https://github.com/yanamlnk/google-challenge/tree/main/skipping-work)

**Second stage**
- [Hey! I Already Did That](https://github.com/yanamlnk/google-challenge/tree/main/hey-i-already-did-that)
- [Gearing Up For Destruction](https://github.com/yanamlnk/google-challenge/tree/main/gearing-up-for-destruction)

**Third stage**
- [Doomsday Fuel](https://github.com/yanamlnk/google-challenge/tree/main/doomsday-fuel)
- [Bomb, Baby](https://github.com/yanamlnk/google-challenge/tree/main/bomb-baby)
- [Prepare the Bunnies' Escape](https://github.com/yanamlnk/google-challenge/tree/main/prepare-the-bunnies-escape)


## Constraints provided by the challenge
> 1. Your code will be compiled using standard Java 8. All tests will be run by calling the solution() method inside the Solution class
> 2. Execution time is limited.
> 3. Wildcard imports and some specific classes are restricted (e.g. java.lang.ClassLoader). You will receive an error when you verify your solution if you have used a blacklisted class.
> 4. Third-party libraries, input/output operations, spawning threads or processes and changes to the execution environment are not allowed.
> 5. Your solution must be under 32000 characters in length including new lines and and other non-printing characters.
